# Stream-DnD-Characters
A C# WinForms application for Displaying basic details of D&D 5e characters for Twitch streams. Built mainly for my own use on Twitch and so
isn't developed to the usual standard I would build a application. Having said that, other people are welcome to use it or fork to use themselves.
